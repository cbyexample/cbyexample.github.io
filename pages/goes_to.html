<h1>The "goes to" (--&gt;) operator</h1>

<p>
The "goes to" operator, a.k.a. <code>--&gt;</code>, is a very useful
operator in C for repeating a block of directives repeatedly as an arithmetic object
approaches a certain value. Here is a nice example demonstrating its usefulness.
</p>

<pre><code>
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main(void)
{
    int i = 30;
    while (i --&gt; 0) {
        printf("i = %d\n", i);
    }

    return 0;
}
</code></pre>

<p>
This can be read "as i goes to 0, ...".
