<h1 id="the-goes-to----operator">The <em>goes to</em> (<code>--&gt;</code>) operator</h1>
<p>The <em>goes to</em> operator, spelled <code>--&gt;</code>, is a useful pseudo-operator in C for looping while an integer object approaches a certain value. Here is a short example demonstrating its utility:</p>
<pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main(void)
{
    int i = 30;
    while (i --&gt; 0)
        printf(&quot;i = %d\n&quot;, i);

    return 0;
}</code></pre>
<p>This can be read &quot;as i goes to 0, ...&quot;.</p>
<p>Whether or not <em>goes to</em> should be used seriously is controversial.</p>
<p>The two arguments against <em>goes to</em> are:</p>
<pre><code>* Because it isn&#39;t a *real* operator, it will confuse people who have never encountered it.

* Syntactically, it&#39;s difficult to tell whether `i` takes on values 30 to 1, or 29 to 0.</code></pre>
<p>Despite this, I advocate for its use, because:</p>
<pre><code>* It&#39;s fun!

* It&#39;s pleasant to look at and easy to read once you&#39;re used to it.</code></pre>
