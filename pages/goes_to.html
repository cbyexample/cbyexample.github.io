<h1 id="the-goes-to----operator">The &quot;goes to&quot; (--&gt;) operator</h1>
<p>The &quot;goes to&quot; operator, a.k.a. <code>--&gt;</code>, is a very useful operator in C for repeating a block of directives repeatedly as an arithmetic object approaches a certain value. Here is a nice example demonstrating its usefulness.</p>
<pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main(void)
{
    int i = 30;
    while (i --&gt; 0) {
        printf(&quot;i = %d\n&quot;, i);
    }

    return 0;
}</code></pre>
<p>This can be read &quot;as i goes to 0, ...&quot;.</p>
