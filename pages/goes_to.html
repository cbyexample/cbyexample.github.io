<h1 id="the-goes-to----operator">The <em>goes to</em> (<code>--&gt;</code>) operator</h1>
<p>The <em>goes to</em> operator, spelled <code>--&gt;</code>, is a useful pseudo-operator in C for looping while an integer object approaches a certain value. Here is a short example demonstrating its utility:</p>
<pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main(void)
{
    int i = 30;
    while (i --&gt; 0)
        printf(&quot;i = %d\n&quot;, i);

    return 0;
}</code></pre>
<p>This can be read &quot;as i goes to 0, ...&quot;.</p>
<p>Whether or not <em>goes to</em> should be used seriously is controversial.</p>
<p>The two arguments against <em>goes to</em> are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Because it isn't a <em>real</em> operator, it will confuse people who have never encountered it.</p></li>
<li><p>Syntactically, it's difficult to tell whether <code>i</code> takes on values 30 to 1, or 29 to 0.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Despite this, I advocate for its use, because:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>It's fun!</p></li>
<li><p>It's pleasant to look at and easy to read once you're used to it.</p></li>
</ul>
